# Why add social features in a work platform?

    * You can't stop people from doing something, linkedin can't stop people from posting selfies and stuff but if you accept that as a possibility and facilitate that, then you can make it happen on your terms.

# Why was animation, video-editing and filmmaking removed as a type

    * They are all going to have the same UI as video. So, they should rather be interest rather than type.
    * If a user select animation then in their video feed they will see animation.

# Why not put services cards on the main page of the profile

    * To show a person price before showing them what a person is capable of is not courteous
    * If we put services in a separate page which is opened through a button on the top of the profile
        * Then we can put that button on article posts as well Near the follow button
        * We will make follow button symbol only on mobile.
